## Bug fixes

This is a great place to start contributing to the repo!

Please open a [Bugfix Proposal](https://github.com/Raj00377/text-reveal/issues/new/choose).

Once you start work on a bug, post your intent on the issue itself. This will prevent more than one person working on it at once.

If the bug you want to work on doesn't have a related issue, open one, and attach the "Bug" label.

## New features

Before adding any features, open a [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/Raj00377/text-reveal/issues/new/choose).

This will let us talk through your proposal or implementation before you spend time on it.

1. Fork the text-reveal repo.
2. Clone your fork to your local computer.
3. Run in your react project
4. Add your code
